Topic of the Day: Javascript's `String.prototype.toUpperCase()`

This one is rather straight forward. If you have a string and you want to convert it to upper case you can use the `toUpperCase()` method on the string prototype.

For Example:

```
const str = "Hiro Protagonist"

console.log(str.toUpperCase())
// "HIRO PROTAGONIST"
```

Did you know that the names 'upper case' and 'lower case' come from the world of type setting?  Back in the day, when an operator was setting the type for a printing run they would keep the case of capital letters above the case of lower case letters on the type setting machine.
